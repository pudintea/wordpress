Use phpMyAdmin to deactivate all plugins.

In the table wp_options, under the option_name column (field) find the active_plugins row
Change the option_value field to: a:0:{}
Or reset your plugins folder via FTP or the file manager provided in your host’s control panel.
This method preserves plugin options but requires plugins be manually reactivated.

#Search By SQL
SELECT * FROM `ypia_options` WHERE `option_name` LIKE 'active_plugins'


Via FTP or your host’s file manager, navigate to the wp-contents folder (directory)
Via FTP or your host’s file manager, rename the folder “plugins” to “plugins.hold”
Login to your WordPress administration plugins page (/wp-admin/plugins.php) – this will disable any plugin that is “missing”.
Via FTP or your host’s file manager, rename “plugins.hold” back to “plugins”
